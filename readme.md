# UniqueList, A type to arrange things in order

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Chadtech/UniqueList.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Chadtech/UniqueList)


A `UniqueList` is like a list, but it cannot have duplicate entries. It is also like a `Set`, except the elements are in order.
